## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS / SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I aimed at getting up to speed with SASS again. Have used it a little in the past, but needed to get into it again. That also gave me the opportunity to catch up with the lattest in Dart SASS. Especially using @use and @forward instead of @import, and the namespacing it brings with it.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - Kevin Powell is a great resource for HTML and CSS. For this project I watched a couple of his videos about SASS, to brush up a little.
